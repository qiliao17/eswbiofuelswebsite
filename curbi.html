<p style="font-size:160%"> When CURBI, the Cornell University Renewable Bioenergy Initiative, was conceived in the late 2010’s, the research and feasibility studies were very thorough. There was no reason technically or scientifically why  CURBI should not have been a resounding success. On the surface, there was also no financial reason why CURBI would fail. However, it was the finances that ultimately caused the project’s breakdown.In the original play, it was estimated that the construction of the CURBI system would cost $9.3million and that the system would incur yearly costs of $500,000. The yearly costs were not a concern as the system would generate around $1 million in electricity and thermal energy, as well as $1.26 million worth of biochar. The problem came with the  original building costs.1It was difficult to find enough grant money and funding to cover the original estimate of $9.3million, however, the directors were confident that they would be able to obtain the funds eventually. Unfortunately, the project ended up having to complete additional safety measures,which nearly tripled the costs. The project also coincided with the Great Recession, which meant the university had fewer funds for new projects and grants were fewer and farther between. CURBI was effectively put on the back burner.

<p style="font-size:160%">
The CURBI team in ESW: Biofuels has been spearheading the effort to revive CURBI and help Cornell achieve its carbon neutrality goals. They have worked with professors, conducted feasibility studies and analyzed waste streams to convince the stakeholders that CURBI and renewable energy is an investment worth doing.</p>
